## Homework 5 - Spatial Data Rendering
The assignment consists of rendering ('plotting'), using R functions that are in spatial-data-oriented packages ("libraries"), the (lat,long) location data you collected for your HW3.You'd need to plot the points you collected for HW3, in two different ways, over a raster map.
- The first way uses the 'tmap, tmaptools, rgdal, sp, OpenStreetMap, osmdata' packages
- The second technique uses the 'PBSmapping, ggmap' packages
